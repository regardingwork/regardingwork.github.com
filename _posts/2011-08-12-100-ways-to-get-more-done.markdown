A friend recently asked us what he could do to reduce procrastination and be more effective. We gave him a few tips but mentioned that there are "hundreds of other things" he could do.

So, here are the first hundred that came to mind. All have worked for one or both of us, but your mileage may vary.

<ol>
    
    <h2>Optimizing your work environment</h2>
    <li>Buy the most comfortable pair of <strong>over-ear headphones</strong> you can find. Wear them all the time, even if you have the music off, as a sign that you are not to be disturbed. If somebody speaks to or waves at you, you can get away with outright ignoring them.</li>
    <li>Don't eat at your desk. Don't read the paper at your desk. Don't watch YouTube or make personal phone calls at your desk. <strong>Treat your desk as a sacred work space</strong> so that next time you sit down, you subconsciously know why you're there and what you need to do.</li>
    <li><strong>Clear everything off your desk</strong> at the start and end of every day. Don't allow yourself the distraction that comes from clutter or personal effects; every little item, even a pen, has the ability to distract. Think of yourself as a chef—before you start the next dish you need to put away the utensils you aren't using and wipe the bench, otherwise you could hurt yourself or contaminate someone's food.</li>
    <li>The same applies to <strong>clearing your desktop</strong>. Create a ritual of closing unused apps and Chrome tabs, saving and filing away notes, and deleting temporary files from your desktop. Do this whenever you complete a task, and before long you will find a great deal of satisfaction in hitting ⌘Q.</li>

    <h2>Setting the mood</h2>
    <li>Avoid starting work with a nagging emotion or stressful distraction on your mind. If this sounds hard, just internalize the following truism: <em>either you can deal with the matter right now, or you can't</em>. If you can deal with it now then deal with it now. If you can't, then there's no harm in <strong>scheduling a later time to worry about it</strong>. Surprisingly, this works no matter how substantial the emotion/stressor is. Worried that your partner is being unfaithful, or that the mole on your arm may be cancerous, or that the Soviet Union is building missile bases in Cuba? Set a RTM task to stress the hell out about it from 7pm to 8pm next Thursday, and get back to work.</li>
    <li><strong>Close all inlets of communication</strong>. If you are on your machine, close all chat applications, disable growl notifications and other notifications, and block yourself out of Gmail. Switch your phone to silent, or better yet turn it off and put it out of reach. Wear headphones, or furrow your eyebrows in such a way as to suggest that Bad Things Will Happen if you are interrupted. You are sitting down to complete an important task, not to be ready to respond to stimulus. The ideal state is one where you are so focussed that a tap on the shoulder would utterly freak you out.</li>
    <li><strong>Have a "starting work" ritual</strong>—a sequence of things that you do before starting work that you will then always associate with work. For Ash, this is making some tea, getting a glass of water, opening all apps that he needs for the task, closing all others, queuing an hour-long mix from one of his favorite DJs on SoundCloud then putting on his headphones. Oz will close all applications, open an empty TextMate window and write the task at the top, sit as upright as possible in his chair, take a deep breath and crank up the dubstep. You can light incense and strike a Himalayan singing bowl if that's what works for you—as long as it involves some sort of evocative stimulus to signal to your subconscious that it's time to focus. Detailed, esoteric rituals are best as then you feel like an idiot if you ever go through the motions then fail to actually commence work.</li>
    
    <h2>Attaining flow</h2>
    <li>Listen to <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubstep">dubstep</a></strong>, a genre of electronic dance music invented to help programmers work faster (also works for the general population). If dubstep isn't doing it for you, try drum and bass, breakbeats or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_noise">Brownian noise</a>. Remember, you want to pick the music (or sounds) that will make you work more effectively, not what will impress your peers or help you attract a mate. Just lie about what you listen to at work, if you have to.</li>
    <li>Learn to <strong>recognize when your work is making you anxious</strong> so that you know to <a href="http://regardingwork.com/2011/07/07/five-minutes-to-lifelong-job-satisfaction/">improve your skills to re-enter your flow channel</a>. Everybody will have their own tells—I know this is happening when I sigh before speaking to a colleague (a sign that I've been holding my breath intermittently while working on a tough problem) or if I find myself sitting on the edge of my bed in the morning, for an extended period of time, with only one sock on, thinking about my first task for the day.</li>
    <li>Learn to <strong>recognize when you are bored at work</strong> so that you know to <a href="http://regardingwork.com/2011/07/07/five-minutes-to-lifelong-job-satisfaction/">increase the difficulty of your work to re-enter your flow channel</a>. Your tells should be quite obvious, if you're paying attention. Typically you'll find yourself procrastinating, looking for small, mindless tasks to do, or contemplating dinner. If you're a manager, you might be on the brink of booking a meeting. My own tells include going for two coffees in one day or realizing that a new album has started playing. My counter-tell is making a cup of tea, then accidentally let it go cold without taking a sip.</li>

    <h2>Using a task list</h2>
    <li>Find, then stick to a good <strong>task list application</strong> we both use <a href="http://rememberthemilk.com">Remember The Milk</a> and recommend it highly. Pick an application that's sophisticated enough that you're likely to still be learning new tricks after a year of daily use. For RTM, your mastery of the tool will involve learning the <a href="https://www.rememberthemilk.com/services/smartadd/">Smart Add</a> symbols and <a href="https://www.rememberthemilk.com/help/answers/basics/keyboard.rtm">keyboard shortcuts</a> finding a few <a href="https://www.rememberthemilk.com/help/answers/smartlists/">smart lists</a> that work for you then <a href="https://www.rememberthemilk.com/forums/tips/">trawling the forum for pro tips</a>.</li>
    <li>Write <strong>achievable tasks</strong>. Heuristic: if a stranger were watching you work, would she be able to pinpoint the minute when you are "done"? This might require picking an arbitrary number of things to list or minutes to spend. If you avoiding picking an arbitrary number and plan to do something to your satisfaction, you will invariably give it insufficient or excessive attention. "Plan career" is not an achievable task. "Write down ten jobs that my mentors have worked" is much better.</li>
    <li>
        <p>Don't write down large tasks. Don't even break down a large task into smaller tasks. Instead, think of the <strong>first task that can be performed in a single sitting</strong> that will lead to your goal. This might look like "spend five minutes brainstorming wedding gift ideas for Richie and Lisa". The next task you schedule will likely depend on the outcome of the first. "Buy Richie and Lisa a wedding gift" is achievable (see above) but problematic as you may discover that you need to seek someone else's opinion, go to a particular store or wait for a particular date.</p>
        <p>If you use the Pomodoro Technique, tasks should be short enough to fit into a single Pomodoro. Otherwise, you will need to learn your tolerance for working on a particular type of task for an extended time period, keeping in mind the cost of diminishing returns. For instance, Oz knows that he can brainstorm for 2-3 minutes with full creativity, research something on the Internet for 10-15 minutes without getting distracted, and write code for 20-30 minutes without accidentally introducing bugs.</p>
    <li>Use <strong>imperative verbs</strong>. It seems insignificant, but a list of tasks that resemble "send nicky a birthday email" or "find the three highest-rated headphones on amazon" turns out to be easier to scan, understand and attack than "nicky birthday message" or "three headphone options amazon".</li>
    <li><strong>Priorities are not tasks</strong>. Feel free to set yourself hundreds of small tasks for a day, but you never have more priorities than you have arms. You should be able to immediately recall your day's priorities as you walk in the door to work, and be able to triage potential tasks against your priorities.</li>

    <h2>Before you start a task...</h2>
    <li>before you start a task, estimate how long it will take. then ask somebody who's done it before, to avoid the planning fallacy</li>
    <li>take the most important thing on your todo list and hide everything else. this will reduce the chance of procrastinating on small tasks</li>
    <li>consider, how much would i pay for somebody else to do this for me? if not very much, you should get someone else to do it! or take it as a sign that this isn't important</li>
    <li>if you are about to start a task for the purpose of X and Y, brainstorm alternative ways to achieve both. is it possible to get X and Y more easily if you seek them out separately?</li>
    <li>ask somebody else what you should do today. don't give them options, just ask them.</li>
    <li>before you start working on a task, explain to someone else why you intend to work on it. if there's noone nearby, speak to your coffee mug. if you are avoiding verbalizing your rationale, you should probably be working on something else</li>
    <li>Take an outsider's view. what would your far-future self say if he saw you doing this? would he think you were wasting your time? If you were giving advice to a friend, would you recommend they work on what you're working on now?</li>

    <h2>Recurring tasks</h2>
    <li>is this something you've done a number of times before? what lessons did you learn last time</li>
    <li>is this something you've done a number of times before? why isn't it easier this time? how can i automate this? You are what you don't automate.</li>
    <li>why did you form this habit in the first place? has the context changed? if you knew then what you know now, would you have started?</li>
    
    <h2>Working on the most important thing</h2>
    <li>Get a friend to audit your task list or calendar at regular intervals.</li>
    <li>write an email to a respected acquaintance listing everything you did today. you'll probably be too embarrassed to hit send, so consider what you'll change tomorrow to make it an email you can be proud of</li>
    <li>know your hourly rate</li>

    <h2>Doing things for the wrong reason</h2>
    <li>don't do things to signal something dumb, like status on intelligence or work ethic</li>
    <li>don't do something just because "it's your job". you have more control over your job than you think. similarly, don't do busy work, as it sets a bad habit</li>
    <li>understand sunk cost bias so you can identify when you're falling for it</li>

    <h2>Conquering email</h2>
    <li>Use <strong>a single Gmail account</strong>. If you have a separate work email address, have it forwarded to your Gmail account. Having a single place for your email will help you with Inbox Zero and similar techniques. Choosing Gmail as your email client will help you become a power user.</li>
    <li>Practice <strong><a href="http://www.43folders.com/izero">Inbox Zero</a></strong>. Do not open Gmail unless you are prepared to work through everything in your inbox. This is easy to achieve if you use a variation of <a href="http://pmarca-archive.posterous.com/the-pmarca-guide-to-personal-productivity">Marc Andreesen's watch/later lists</a> where every email is either ignored, replied to or scheduled to be reviewed later. I've found I don't need a "watch" label so I simply set time-insensitive emails to "review" and deal with them the next Saturday morning.</li>
    <li>Learn the important <strong><a href="https://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=6594">Gmail keyboard shortcuts</a></strong>. When you're writing a reply, press tab then return to send. Compose (<strong>c</strong>), open (<strong>o</strong>), reply (<strong>r</strong>), archive (<strong>e</strong>) and label (<strong>l</strong>) will take you a very long way. Once you've habitualized those, you may also get some mileage out of select (<strong>x</strong>), previous (<strong>j</strong>), next (<strong>k</strong>), forward (<strong>f</strong>) go to inbox (<strong>g</strong> then <strong>i</strong>) and go to search box (<strong>/</strong>).</li>
    <li>Turn on a few <strong>useful <a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#settings/labs">Gmail labs</a> features</strong> to speed up your workflow. The three most important are Background Send, Auto-advance and Send &amp; Archive. Each is individually useful, but the three together provide a graceful Inbox Zero workflow: write your reply then tab-enter to send in the background, archive the original and immediately open the next thing to respond to. Auto-advance also helps while working through your "review" list as it knows to only advance through appropriately labeled messages.</li>
    <li>If you find yourself in the middle of a long multi-person email chain, you must either be the person to <strong>end the conversation, or totally disengage from it</strong> (setting to "review" then muting works for me).</li>
    <li><strong>Avoid "reply to all"</strong>, if you can. Invariably, one of the many recipients will feel compelled to reply, creating more work for you when they do.</li>
    <li><strong>Avoid email subscriptions</strong> such as newsletters and daily deals. If an email comes from a noreply@ email address, it's a sign that you should unsubscribe. When considering whether to unsubscribe from seemingly useful emails such as Google Groups digests, ask yourself "how much would I pay to receive these". The answer is almost always "close to zero".</li>
    <li>If you work allows it, <strong>only check your email at pre-scheduled times in the day</strong>. I'm currently striving for morning, noon and night but haven't quite conquered this one yet. <a href="http://regardingwork.com/2011/05/15/the-tragedy-of-the-interruption-junkie/">Like with many other addictions</a>, the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_ctJqjlrHA">variable ratio reinforcement schedule</a> of checking email results in adverse <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operant_conditioning">operant conditioning</a>. The first step is to stop yourself from indulging in unscheduled "quick hits" during the day.</li>
    
    <h2>Fast, focused writing</h2>
    <li>Pick a good text editor and stick to it long enough to master it. For non-programmers using Mac OS X I would recommend TextMate as it's simple enough to use straight away and will grow with you.</li>
    <li>Rebind caps to ctrl. There's no need for caps</li>
    <li>Try a full-screen writing app like <a href="http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/writeroom"> Writeroom</a>.</li>
    
    <h2>Fast, focused Mac OS X use</h2>
    <li>Use spotlight. This will allow you to have an empty dock. Then hide the dock. You can't remove it entirely, but you can make it tiny so there's less chance of you accidentally exposing it.</li>
    <li>Have all content you need accessible all the time, on any machine. Storing all of your docs, work, etc. in the cloud with <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a> or <a href="https://www.docs.google.com/">Google Docs</a> will enable you to work on anything whenever and wherever you feel the urge.</li>
   	<li>Use (even if loosely) an informative, extensible file naming system that you have internalized rather than spending time creating a folder system. Then, use Spotlight (⌘ + space) to find files fast, rather than navigating through folder systems.</li>
    <li>Habitualize simple keyboard navigation. ctrl-a ctrl-e for start and end of line. option left/right for moving one word at a time.</li>
    <li>Use <a href="http://mizage.com/divvy/">Divvy</a> to control the windows in your workspace.</li>
	<li>Regularly use full screen apps to increase focus and as part of your productivity commencement ritual (!! link to number). There's usually an option in the 'View' menu of most apps in Mac OS X and it's <a href='http://www.apple.com/macosx/whats-new/full-screen.html'>built into Lion</a>.</li>
    <li>Use a password manager like<a href= "http://agilebits.com/products/1Password/"> 1Password</a>. You should not waste time recalling and mental space keeping a log of all of your passwords. Besides, the password manager will be better at generating long, complex passwords than you.</li>
    <li>Once you decide that you no longer need an app, zap it with with  <a href= "http://appzapper.com/"> AppZapper</a>. Your Applications folder is a distraction in itself.</li>
    <li>Consider <a href="http://al3x.net/2008/09/08/al3xs-rules-for-computing-happiness.html"> al3x's Rules for Computing Happiness </a>, particularly those under 'Hardware' to ensure that you are using a machine that suits your needs and don't own hardware you don't need.</li>
    
    <h2>Fast, focused web use</h2>
    <li>Use <strong>Google Chrome</strong>. It's the fastest browser and will allow you to use some handy extensions.</li>
    <li>Install and use <strong><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gighmmpiobklfepjocnamgkkbiglidom">AdBlock</a></strong>. This is one of the easiest steps you can take toward distraction-free Web use.</li>
    <li>Install and use the <strong><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ceeeklhkohcmbifadglfhfjfamnhefje">Google Plus Bar Minus</a></strong> Chrome extension to hide the universal Google toolbar thing. I find it to be a significant distraction, particularly when the little red Google+ notifier lights up. On the rare occasion where you need to use the toolbar, you can temporarily show it by clicking the extension's icon.</li>
    <li><strong>Don't read long articles through your browser</strong>. <a href="http://instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a> might work for you, but my preferred workflow is using the <a href="http://www.readability.com/addons">Readability Chrome extension</a> to send articles directly to my Kindle (for free) with ⇧⌃K. This will ensure that you actually engage with whole articles in one sitting, rather than flipping through them between other tasks, and may also have the added benefit of a more pleasant reading experience on the Kindle's e-ink screen.</li>
    <li><strong>Clean out your bookmarks</strong> and keep the bookmarks bar hidden (press ⇧⌘B right now). You shouldn't need to keep bookmarks—sites you visit regularly will be easily to recall the URL for (either by you or by autocomplete in the Chrome location bar), articles can be read later (see above) and other pages you come across that merit further investigation should be scheduled as later research tasks.</li>
    <li><strong>Set a useful startup page</strong> for Chrome (⌘, will bring up the Preferences pane). For me, this is <a href="http://rememberthemilk.com">RTM</a>.</li>
    <li>Learn basic Chrome keyboard shortcuts. ⌘L to focus on the location bar, space and shift-space to move down and up a page, ⌘T to open a new tab, ⇧⌘T to open a new tab with the contents of the last closed tab (surprisingly useful!). ⌘F to find, extra find commands etc !!</li>
    <li>Consider using a mouse replacement.!!</li>

    <h2>Conquering procrastination</h2>
    <li><strong>Schedule your chores</strong>, so that you can't use them as a way to procrastinate. If "clean the bathroom" is a monthly scheduled RTM task and you nonetheless find yourself contemplating it during the month, then you're likely avoiding a more important task.</li>
    <li>Try the <strong><a href="http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/">Pomodoro Technique</a></strong>. This one's not for me, but many people swear by it.</li>
	<li>Try ticking off small milestones within the time you have dedicated to a task, where the task is suited to this. For example, if you have to write 1,000 words in two hours then write 100 ten times on a piece of paper and tick the markers off as you reach thm, just like you would watch the mileage tick over on a treadmill.</li>
    <li>Use <strong><a href="https://www.rescuetime.com/">RescueTime</a></strong> to automatically log your productive and unproductive activities. The point is not to treat productivity as a game or to obsesses over your daily stats. Instead, just schedule a regular time (say once a month) to audit your RescueTime stats looking for patterns of low productivity and problem apps and Web sites.</li>
    <li><strong>Block problem Web sites</strong>. I've been using the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/laankejkbhbdhmipfmgcngdelahlfoji">StayFocusd extension</a> to block out the entire work week, but you could similarly use RescueTime's "Get Focused..." feature.</li>

    <h2>Having a focused life</h2>
    <li>consciously-formed habits are generally beneficial, accidental habits are generally detrimental</li>
    <li>have an engrossing go-to question or challenge. use this as a substitute thought when trying to break some habitual thought</li>
    <li>quit tv</li>
    <li>Quit reading the news. Stay out of date on news and current affairs. Ignore sports and the economy. You can't change any of this, it is often stressful and there is <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2010/11/bah-sophistication.html">no value to being sophisticated</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Don't keep a calendar</strong>. Work only on your priorities at any given time depending on how you feel. Scheduling coffees and calls with people weeks ahead of time means that you are setting yourself up with multiple barriers or enforced breaks in flow. One tool that helps me do this is <a href="www.tungle.me">Tungle</a>. There, I block out long periods of uninterrupted time every week, essentially leaving 'office hours' for calls with friends, introductions to new acquaintances etc. You can mask any potential signs of disrespect or anti-social behavior by touting the other benefits of Tungle - all of which are quite valuable - for example, it syncs with your calendars to prevent overlaps, shows the times in the viewers timezone and allows the proposer to propose multiple times.</li>
    <li><strong>Don't answer the phone</strong>. Phones are perhaps the most disruptive devices that we still allow in our lives. Turn off all notifications and ringers, use <a href="http://voice.google.com">Google Voice</a> to have your voicemails transcribed to text and answer SMS, then batch process all missed calls/voicemails/SMS when you have a break in productivity.</li>
    <li>have a small identity. this way you avoid the high cost of maintaining it. neglect to have an opinion on politics. neglect to have an opinion on important social matters. !! pg article</li>
    <li>don't learn what you can just look up. spend that time improving your thinking instead</li>
    <li>Have less stuff</li>
    
    <h2>Keeping inane things off your mind</h2>
    <li>Realize that other people pay less attention to you than you think. While you can't totally neglect your appearance and personal hygiene, you can probably afford to dial it down by !!%.</li>
    <li><strong>Don't stress out about things you can't change</strong>. Earthquakes, stock market movements and the weather have nothing to do with you and cannot be affected by you. Write a list of the things in your life that you do have control over, and direct your stress at them instead.</li>
    <li><strong>Expel everything from now as a task</strong>, so that you don't dwell on something that can only be done later and so that you don't ever have to remember anything. Use an app on your phone, RTM's personal email address (/Settings/Info) and always have RTM open on your machine so that you can just write it down and move on with what you currently have to do.</li>
    <li>Use <a href="http://sabi.net/nriley/software/">Pester</a> so that you don't have to remember any time-sensitive tasks.</li>
    <li>If you have portable access to email, send yourself todos. Otherwise, carry around a small notebook and telescopic pen!! move this to "Get things off your mind?"</li>
    
    <h2>Wellbeing</h2>
    <li>Quit smoking. Cigarettes give you a physical impulse to drop everything that you're doing - very productive tasks included - to put another nail in your coffin.</li>
    <li>Drink less. You will spend less weekends in bed, have a clearer head and make better decisions about how long you stay out while on nights out. Drinking kills, makes you unproductive and doesn't make you more interesting.</li>
    <li>Sleep. When you are tired you just don't have the energy for intense focus and lose it very easily by drifting to less intense tasks.</li>
    <li>quit sugar, then high-gi carbs, then carbs, then other insulinogenic food and drink (sweeteners, gum, )</li>
	<li>Monitor the effect of caffeine on your alertness. Caffeine can be amazing way to increase focus and <a href='https://twitter.com/#!/JerrySeinfeld/status/98134900338733056'>get things done</a>, but it can also simply induce jitters that make you more open to distraction.</li>
    <li>exercise tactically. Start you daily workout when you hit a plateau and make sure that you have a number of tasks ready for immediately after to take advantage of the energy boost and endorphin high.</li>
    <li>take naps</li>
    <li>Recover when you need to. Working when you're sick can be demoralizing and significantly interfere with proper recovery.</li>
    <li>Manage pain and injuries. Anything from a cuts to back pain can be significant, unpredictable interruptions and put you off for months at a time.</li>

    <h2>Plateau busting</h2>
    <li>Find <strong>different people</strong> to work with. This may involve starting to collaborate with somebody whose smarter or more creative than you are, or who you know is likely to take a different approach to you. Alternatively, it could involve ceasing work with a regular collaborator such that you can try taking on the corresponding responsibility yourself.</li>
    <li><strong>Divide and conquer</strong>. Large tasks sometimes present a crippling psychological barrier which can be overcome by splitting it into 10 minute constituent tasks. Better yet, by listing steps one to five, you may realize that steps two and four are unnecessary, and that the macro task is easier than you originally anticipated.</li>
    <li><strong>Write a long list</strong>. What you decide to list hardly matters, just pick a topic and a large number and start writing. You'll come up with the first N items instantly. The next N will be harder, and require a fresh perspective or two. Don't stop there—force yourself to list N more and you'll be exercising creative parts of your brain that you may have let atrophy. Surprisingly, this creativity is often transferable to your original task, however distant it was to the subject of the list. <a href="http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2011/08/nine-ways-to-light-your-creativity-on-fire/">James Altucher is an absolute pro at this</a>.</li>
	<li>Engage in <strong><a href='http://structuredprocrastination.com/'>Structured Procrastination</a></strong>. This is helpful in compressing your available time for high-priority tasks to increase urgency, consolidating low-priority tasks into allocated time, working on self-deception and determining the true importance of all tasks.</li>
    <li><strong>Go back over old lists</strong> or journal entries that you habitually make. For example, Ash has an RTM list for what may just be silly business or blog post ideas. These sometimes get him onto something significant and otherwise it's good to get them permanently off one's mind.</li>
    <li>have a sacred thinking spot, like a cafe you only go to by yourself, or a tree that nobody else would think to sit under (!! remove?)</li>

    <h2>Further study</h2>
    <li><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)">Learn about flow</a></strong> so that whenever you have a chance you can opt for fulfilling rather than temporarily pleasurable activities. Some of Csikszentmihalyi's conclusions are non-trivial, for instance shooting the breeze with old friends is deceptively fun but rarely fulfilling, whereas talking to a stranger can sometimes induce a flow state.</li>
    <li>Learn <strong><a href="http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/How_To_Actually_Change_Your_Mind">how to actually change your mind</a></strong>. It turns out that <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/jx/we_change_our_minds_less_often_than_we_think/">this is incredibly hard to do</a>. The better you are at changing your mind, the less time you'll spend working on the wrong problem or applying the wrong solution.</li>

    <h2>For the truly dedicated</h2>
    <li>Consider switching to the <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard">Dvorak keyboard layout</a></strong> for faster, more comfortable typing. Having used Dvorak exclusively for ~5 years now—and having subsequently forgotten how to type in QWERTY—I wouldn't recommend this if you regularly work on other people's computers. While the jury is still out on how helpful Dvorak really is, at least you'll be using the same keyboard layout as <a href="http://rcranger.mysite.syr.edu/famhist/blackburn.htm">the world's fastest typist</a>.</li>
    <li>Decide on and stick to a personal uniform (!! steve jobs link?). You wont realize until you do this how much time others spend on deciding what to wear, whether they need to buy more things, how they look today (does my butt look big in this particular thing?) and so on. !! cut?</li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Don't eat during the day</strong>. I only started doing this recently, but have found it quite liberating. Every day, I have fewer thoughts about when and what to eat, whether I should go to the kitchen to snack on something, and so on. I don't suffer from cortisol spikes (food comas), subject my colleagues to low blood sugar moodiness, or experience hunger pangs at noon from <a href="http://www.physorg.com/news170688849.html">circadian ghrelin troughs</a>. Counter-intuitively, I experience far less hunger now than when I ate breakfast and lunch.</p>
        <p>Fasting for the entire day is not realistic unless you first become accustomed to a low-carb, high-fat diet.
